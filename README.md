# Movie Finder Data
> Uses the Express framework to build a server that can talk to another server and cache the results.

This was my sixth project at Origin Code Academy. This server was created using NodeJS, Express, morgan, and axios.

## Approach

This app demonstrates running a server that can talk to another server using NodeJS with the Express framework. The middleware used for this app: [morgan](https://github.com/expressjs/morgan) and [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios). Morgan is an HTTP request logger for Node.js and I used it to log all incoming requests. Axios is a promise based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js, and requests were made using this library.

## Installation

Download all associated files and load them up in your favorite text editor!

## Development setup

This app relies on NodeJS, Express, morgan, and axios for its functionality. 

I recommend using [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) to run this server.

```sh
npm install -g nodemon
// cd to-your-web-folder
nodemon server
```
